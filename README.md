# Get to Know Me — AR Experience

This is an interactive **Augmented Reality website** that introduces you to who I am — not just a resume, but a personal, immersive experience. Think of it as my digital business card in 3D space!

## Why I Built This

Traditional resumes and portfolios are flat and static. I wanted to explore how **AR can humanize introductions** — by turning information into motion, emotion, and immersion.

This also reflects my interest in **AR/VR, AI, and creative tech** — and my drive to create more engaging ways of sharing information.

## Tech Stack

- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) (WebXR + 3D scene management)  
- [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) (Markerless/Webcam AR)  
- Vanilla JS  
- Simple PNG graphics and fonts  
- Fully browser-based (no app installation required!)

## How to Use It

1. **Visit the website** on your phone or desktop (with a camera).  
2. Grant camera permission when prompted.  
3. Watch as floating bubbles appear and share bits of information about me!  
4. Works best in well-lit environments.
